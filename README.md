# React CRUD consuming Odoo API module

This project is just that: A React frontend consuming an Odoo API.

This example is about bicyles. 

So a "bicycles" odoo module has been created, which is consumed from React.

The frontend is based on bezcoder example:
https://www.bezkoder.com/react-hooks-crud-axios-api/

## Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Install it if you want to deploy this project with Docker.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/react-consuming-odoo-api.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

### In your Backend:

You can use Docker for your backend. Once you have your Docker-Desktop running just:

```
cd react-consuming-odoo-api/backend
docker-compose up -d
```

Now you should be able to access your Odoo installation. Follow the steps to install the "bicycles" module:

Enter credentials and remember data to later update frontend/.env file:

![Create Project](/screenshots/2-starting-alt.png)

Edit URL adding `?debug=1` to enter developper mode in Odoo:

Update Apps List to be able to install `bicycles` module:

![Create Project](/screenshots/4-starting.png)

Install `bicycles` module:

![Create Project](/screenshots/5-starting-alt.png)

Check that `bicycles` module is installed:

![Create Project](/screenshots/6-starting.png)

Follow similar steps to install "auth_session_info" module. The result would be:

![Create Project](/screenshots/6-y-medio-starting.png)

After installing "auth_session_info" modify the 2 following files in module "web". Notice the red marked places:

File `addons/web/controllers/main.py`:

File `addons/web/models/ir_http.py`:
![Create Project](/screenshots/8-web-models-ir_http.py-alt.png)

Don't forget to restart the Odoo container:

```
docker restart odoo-frontend
```

### In your Frontend:

You need a node.js working environment. The 16.19.0 LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

At the moment of the creation of this project the http-proxy-middleware is not working with node 18 LTS so node 16 LTS is highly recommended.

```
$ node --version
v16.19.0
```

Once you have cloned your project install all dependencies.

```
cd react-consuming-odoo-api/frontend
npm install
```

To configure your environment you can create a frontend/.env file: 

```
PORT=8081
REACT_APP_ODOO_BASEURL=http://localhost:8069
REACT_APP_ODOO_DB=bike-shop
REACT_APP_ODOO_LOGIN=alberto@tiburcio.com
REACT_APP_ODOO_PASSWORD=albertotiburcio
```

Now you can start your frontend React App:

```
npm start
```

If you follow the former instructions the 2 different parts of this project will be running on the following urls:
* Frontend (http://localhost:8081)
* Backend (http://localhost:8069)

Enjoy!!!

## The most interesting parts of the project:

The most interesting files to check are:
* File `backend/extra-addons/bicycles/controllers/controllers.py`, which implement the CRUD operations in ODOO resulting in the API to be consumed.
* File `frontend/src/services/BicycleService.js`, where you can see how the frontend consumes the ODOO API.
* File `frontend/src/setupProxy.js`, where you can see the configuration of http-proxy-middleware which has been used to avoid CORS problems in development environment.
* module auth_session_info available for Odoo 13. You can download this module from https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/13.0/auth_session_info. This module makes possible to return the session_id. To make it work in Odoo 14 is also necessary to update the files `addons/web/controllers/main.py` and `addons/web/models/ir_http.py`.

## Interesting commands to create your own Odoo module

With this command you can enter into an odoo container:

```
docker exec -it <odoo-container-id> bash
```

With this command you can create the skeletton of a module in odoo:
```
/usr/bin/odoo scaffold bicycles /mnt/extra-addons/
```
